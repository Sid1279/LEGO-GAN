### A deep convolutional generative adversarial neural network to generate realistic images of LEGO minifigures

`LEGO_DCGAN/minifig_images` contains images of LEGO minifigures to train the model. Performed web scraping via [Rebrickable](https://rebrickable.com/).

`LEGO_DCGAN/minifig_output` contains generated images for each trial during training. 

`LEGO_DCGAN/generated`: has several generated images by running `LEGO_DCGAN/generated/inference.py`. Give it a try yourself ;)

Below are some 128x128 images of images generated by the DCGAN generator:
